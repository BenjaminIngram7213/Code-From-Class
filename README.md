CS 220 Class Code
=================

This is the code we wrote together in class.


## Git best practices

- commits
  - use meaningful/descriptive commit messages.
  - 1 sentence is fine
  - commits should package related changes to your code
  - shouldn't be too big or too small
    - ex: one significant function, or a group of small, related functions, would make a good commit

- branches
  - good for trying out ideas that you're not sure will remain
  - can later be merged into a master branch
  - not necessary in 220, but you can use them if you'd like
